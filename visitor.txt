VISITOR 

> types in the search box then hits enter or clicks search button
	-will check if the visitor typed any character, if none, a notification will be shown
> (valid input) redirects to another page and now performs the query
	-the default search would be by title, alphabetical arrangement)

> will now display the results, 10 per page (pagination will be used), alphabetical order
	-info to be shown: Title, author(s), year published, publisher, course code
	-there will be a link below each result "view book" which when clicked, redirects 
	 the visitor to the full details of the book if available or not w/ current number in
	 the library.

> advanced search is also available. it is a button that when clicked, a modal will appear and
  there you will find a form for searching the Title, author(s), year published, publisher,
  course code.

* each single result will have a "reserve" button located beside "view book". since it is only
  a visitor, a pop-up/modal will show that you must first log-in to be able to reserve.

* different sorting schemes will show just below the search field. (by year, A-Z, Z-A, by course
  code, alphabetical by author).

* search algorithm: will search for the whole typed keyword, if no results found, tokenize the
  typed keyword and query every keyword.

Carting system 

> User has logged in and Reference material is available.

> User presses “Add To Cart” button found near the Title of the reference material they 
  wish to reserve.

> Adds to the cart with notification to be shown that it was successfully added to cart.
 (since it won't affect the database, adding to cart won't check for availability of book)

> cart will display Title, author, year. a reserve button is also shown per entry.
  if reserve button is clicked, if successfull, the item will be removed.

* add to cart button won't show in the results per search unless logged in.

* it has remove this item from cart and empty cart feature.

* there will be select button on left for removing of selected items from cart.

* view cart is a button that when clicked, it will show the user's cart

* one cart entry per book, meaning the quantity will always be one; thus editing the cart is
  unneccessary

* carting may have a limit (20 books i guess?)
